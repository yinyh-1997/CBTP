# Comparative benchmarking of single-cell clustering algorithms for transcriptomic and proteomic data

## Description
We performed a comparative benchmarking analysis of **28** clustering methods using paired single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic data. We evaluated these methods based on metrics such as ARI, NMI, CA, and Purity, as well as running time and peak memory consumption. The benchmarking results help compare the performance of these methods on real and simulated datasets, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach for single-cell omics data analysis. Here is the pipeline for our benchmarking work.

These methods utilize a variety of clustering strategies, including community detection-based, machine learning-based, deep learning-based, to analyze and cluster single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic data. Below is a collection of useful links and titles for each method.

  - `./ClusteringAlgorithms_Python/script_integration_clustering.py`
- **Purpose**: These scripts implement and evaluate various Python-based clustering algorithms, providing insights into the efficiency and accuracy of each method.
- **Execution**: Run the scripts in your Python environment.
  ```bash
  python script_rna_adt_clustering.py
  python script_integration_clustering.py

### For R-based Clustering Algorithms
- **Scripts**:
  - `./ClusteringAlgorithms_R/script_rna_adt_clustering.R`
  - `./ClusteringAlgorithms_R/script_integration_clustering.R`
- **Purpose**: These scripts implement and evaluate various R-based clustering algorithms, providing insights into the efficiency and accuracy of each method.
- **Execution**: Run the scripts in your R environment.
  ```R
